RabbitMQ :
is a message-queueing software also known as a message broker or queue manager. Simply said; it is software where queues are defined,
to which applications connect in order to transfer a message or messages.
A message broker acts as a middleman for various services (e.g. a web application).
They can be used to reduce loads and delivery times of web application servers by delegating tasks that would normally take up a lot of time or resources to a third party that has no other job.
